[🗡️ SwissKnife for MS Graph v1.1.0](https://github.com/Nemu-x/SwissKnife-for-MS-Graph/releases/tag/v1.1.0) is out.

# SwissKnife for MS Graph 1.1.0 — "Where did the email go"

The first release after the task-first rewrite. Exchange Web Services starts
being disabled on 1 October 2026 and the Reporting Web Service behind
`Get-MessageTrace` is already deprecated, so this release leans into what
Graph now offers on the mail side, finishes the offboarding story, adds a
command-line mode, and prepares the app for the package managers you already
use.

## Highlights

### Message trace — "Where did this email go?"

A new tile on the **Audit** page next to "why can this person not sign in?".
Give a sender, a recipient, or both (external addresses are fine), a window of
up to 10 days within the last 90, and you get the delivery status of every
matching message; pick a row to see its hops through Exchange Online
(delivered, quarantined, filtered, failed, pending). Uses the Graph v1.0
endpoint `/admin/exchange/tracing/messageTraces` that replaces the Reporting
Web Service cmdlets.

The endpoint has a prerequisite the docs do not make obvious: the tenant needs
a service principal for Microsoft's *Transport Data Platform* application,
otherwise Graph rejects the call even with the permission consented. The app
checks for it and offers to create it (one-time write, `Application.ReadWrite.All`
for that single click). It can take a few hours to become effective on
Microsoft's side, and the tile says so.

### Mailbox copy in offboarding

**Offboarding** gains **Copy a leaver's mailbox to someone else**, also
available as a step of the offboarding playbook. The leaver's mail folders
(optionally contacts and calendar items) are recreated under a folder inside
the target user's mailbox through the mailbox import/export Graph APIs
(GA May 2026), item by item in full fidelity, with a preview of the scope, a
live cancellable log and a report of failed items. The playbook runs it right
after the OneDrive backup and before license removal, because the mailbox dies
with the license.

It does not replace converting the mailbox to shared (Graph still has no API
for that) and it does not produce a PST. Microsoft positions these APIs for
migration, and that is what this is: the mail lands in a colleague's mailbox
without keeping a licensed account around.

### Entra recommendations

**Security → What Entra recommends fixing** lists Microsoft's own daily
analysis of the tenant (per-user MFA to convert, stale apps and credentials,
legacy migrations, Identity Secure Score items) as facts: priority, status,
why it applies, the action steps with their portal links, and the impacted
resources on click. Read-only. The API is still served from `/beta`, and the
Identity Protection and Secure Score items appear only on Entra ID P2 tenants.

### Tenant configuration snapshot & drift

**Security → Snapshot tenant configuration** saves Conditional Access policies,
named locations, admin roles with their members, the authorization and
authentication-method policies, licenses, domains, groups and app
registrations (with credential expiry) into one local JSON file. **What changed
since the last snapshot?** compares two snapshots and lists what was added,
removed or changed, field by field — for a change-control record, or to find
out what a colleague clicked last Friday. Sections the app is not allowed to
read are skipped and marked, never fatal.

### Command-line mode

The same binary runs headless when started with arguments: same profiles,
same audit log and journal, no window.

```powershell
SwissKnifeGraph get '/users?$select=displayName' --all --json
SwissKnifeGraph user alice@contoso.com
SwissKnifeGraph signins alice@contoso.com --failed --days 3
SwissKnifeGraph offboard alice@contoso.com --confirm alice@contoso.com --block --revoke --hide-gal
```

`--profile` picks a saved profile (optional when there is one), `--json` gives
machine-readable output, `--read-only` blocks writes. Offboarding steps stream
live to stderr. Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 failed, 2 usage error. On Windows the
output goes to the console that launched it. See the *Command line* wiki page.

### Package managers

Manifests for **winget** (`Nemu-x.SwissKnifeGraph`), **Scoop**
(`swissknife-graph`) and a **Homebrew** cask ship in `packaging/`, and the
release workflow updates winget automatically once the first submission is
accepted. Arch users keep `yay -S swissknife-graph-bin`. Direct downloads and
the minisign-signed checksums are unchanged.

### Self-contained AppImage

The Linux AppImage now bundles GTK, WebKitGTK and its helper processes, so it
runs on any distro with glibc 2.35 or newer without installing `webkit2gtk-4.1`
first (the 1.0.0 AppImage needed it from the system). It is built on Ubuntu
22.04 and smoke-tested in CI on a machine without WebKit. The asset is renamed
to `SwissKnifeGraph-x86_64.AppImage` / `SwissKnifeGraph-aarch64.AppImage`
(AppImage convention: no "linux" in the name); the deb, rpm and tar.gz keep
their names and their distro dependencies.

### In-app updater fixed on Windows

**Update now** on 1.0.0 downloaded the installer and then failed with
*"The requested operation requires elevation"*: the installer is per-machine
and the app could not raise a UAC prompt. It now launches the installer
through the shell with the `runas` verb, so one UAC dialog appears (the button
says so beforehand). A declined prompt is reported as such and the button
stays usable; any other failure offers to show the downloaded installer so
you can run it by hand.

## Notes

- **New permissions** (all optional; only for the features you use):
  `ExchangeMessageTrace.Read.All` for message trace, plus
  `Application.ReadWrite.All` once, only to create the Transport Data Platform
  service principal; `MailboxFolder.ReadWrite.All`, `MailboxItem.Read.All` and
  `MailboxItem.ImportExport.All` (application permissions; to limit them to
  specific mailboxes use an Exchange RBAC for Applications role with a
  management scope instead of the tenant-wide consent) for the mailbox copy;
  `DirectoryRecommendations.Read.All` for recommendations; `Policy.Read.All`,
  `RoleManagement.Read.Directory`, `Directory.Read.All` and
  `Application.Read.All` for the configuration snapshot. The Permissions wiki
  page has the full matrix.
- No configuration changes. Profiles, secrets, presets and the run journal are
  untouched. Snapshots are stored next to them in the app data folder.
- The release workflow can sign Windows builds with Azure Trusted Signing and
  sign and notarize macOS builds when the corresponding secrets are set; this
  release is still unsigned on both, so the DMG keeps the quarantine fix and
  Windows ARM64 builds remain best-effort.
- `Chat.Read.All` for the Teams chat backup step is still a protected API; the
  step stays blocked until Microsoft approves your app id.
