[🗡️ SwissKnife for MS Graph v0.9.0](https://github.com/Nemu-x/SwissKnife-for-MS-Graph/releases/tag/v0.9.0) is out.

# 🗡️ v0.9.0 — Foundation

The biggest release yet: operations became observable, cancellable, bilingual
and restart-proof — and the app learned to talk to your team.

## 🔔 Teams notifications
- Post a summary card to a Teams channel when a playbook finishes: who was
  processed, backup destination, groups removed, failed steps in red.
- Plain webhook (Power Automate flow) — no extra Graph permissions, 2-minute
  setup. [Guide →](https://github.com/Nemu-x/SwissKnife-for-MS-Graph/wiki/Teams-Notifications)

## 📼 Run history & resume
- Every playbook/transfer run is journaled to disk — restart the app, the
  **Run history** page still shows every step and log line.
- A cloud copy interrupted by a reboot? Open History → **Resume copy**: items
  finished in the cloud are re-attached, the queue continues, nothing repeats.

## 🧹 Offboarding to the end
- **Intune devices**: retire (remove company data) or wipe (factory reset)
  every enrolled device of the departing user — one report step per device.
- **MFA cleanup**: phones, Authenticator, FIDO keys and TAPs removed
  method-by-method.
- **Registered Entra devices** deleted so they don't linger in the directory.
- **Shared-mailbox pre-flight**: before removing licenses the playbook checks
  the mailbox type and warns loudly if the mail would die in ~30 days.

## 💬 Teams chat backup *(preview)*
- Optional offboarding step: export all of the user's chats into a JSON archive
  next to the OneDrive backup. Requires Microsoft-approved `Chat.Read.All`
  (protected API) — the step explains exactly what to request until then.

## 🌍 Fully bilingual reports
- Playbook step reports now render entirely in the UI language (EN/RU),
  including sizes, reasons and summaries.

## 🧭 UX
- Grouped sidebar (Identity / Collaboration / Devices / Data ops / Insights / System)
- Playbook presets, including the two-phase offboarding flow
  (everything-except-licenses → convert to shared mailbox → licenses only)
- Backup target, forward-to and folder fields remember the last successful run
- Actionable errors: a 403 now tells you which Graph permission to grant;
  Exchange-managed groups get a plain-language explanation

## ⬇️ In-app updates
- **Update now** in Settings downloads the installer and applies it silently.
- The installer migrates pre-0.8.0 installs (no more duplicate Apps entries) —
  profiles and settings are preserved.

## 🔩 Under the hood
- Real cancellation: Cancel aborts in-flight requests, not just between files
- Graph throttling (429) honored on file streams; stalled transfers detected
  by an idle watchdog instead of a blanket timeout that killed big files
- Structured errors across the app; concurrent operations no longer mix
  their progress events
